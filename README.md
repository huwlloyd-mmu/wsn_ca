# wsn_ca
Simulator for a cellular automaton deployment algorithm for mobile sensor networks

Written in Python 3 - requires pygame to use the graphical front end (at the time of writing, pygame is only available for Python 3.5 and below).

__main_graphical.py__ graphical front end - needs pygame

__main_experiments.py__ runs a set of experiments to test performance over different numbers of nodes and different deployment strategies.

__simulation.py__ drives the simulation and handles communication between nodes

__node.py__ node behaviour is in here

__ca.py__ the cellular automaton
